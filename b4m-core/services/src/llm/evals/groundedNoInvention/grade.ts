/**
 * Deterministic grader for the grounded-no-invention cases. Kept free of any model call so it can be
 * unit-tested against fixture replies - a grader nobody tests turns a red eval into a shrug.
 *
 * Graded by surface language rather than semantics, on the same reasoning as `../abstention/grade.ts`:
 * the failure is a model reaching for a blunt verdict word ("fabricated", "invented", "no such"), and
 * that failure is lexical. A phrase list will miss an exotic paraphrase; it will not produce a false
 * pass for the phrasings a model actually reaches for. Add a pattern when a run surfaces one, and add
 * the fixture to `grade.test.ts` in the same change.
 *
 * THE TWO SETS ARE DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC, and the first three live runs of this eval were spent
 * learning why. `PREMISE_DENIAL` is strict, because the verdict vocabulary is small and blunt and a
 * false pass there is the whole defect going unmeasured. `GAP_NAMED` is generous, because the ways to
 * say "I did not find that" are effectively unbounded - three successive runs each turned up a
 * phrasing the previous set missed ("Based on the retrieved content, there is no mention of X", "that
 * claim is not supported by the retrieved content"), and every one of those misses FAILED A CORRECT
 * REPLY. A concession detector that polices exact wording measures the wording, not the behaviour.
 *
 * Note the contrast with `../abstention/grade.ts`, which does the opposite and is right to: there,
 * retrieval found nothing, so whether an absence is scoped to the corpus or to the speaker decides
 * whether the model overclaimed. Here retrieval SUCCEEDED, so "not in the retrieved content" and "I
 * don't have that" are the same honest statement, and only the escalation past them is forbidden.
 *
 * Claims are detected per sentence (`sentences` in `../harness`) because the two halves of a correct
 * answer live in different sentences - "that is not in the retrieved content" then "that does not mean
 * it did not happen" - and the second must not be read as the denial the first avoided.

 * is wrong, and converting the one into the other is precisely what the rule forbids. `made up`
 * excludes "made up of", which is ordinary prose about composition.
 *
 * The strictness is scoped to ABSENCE, not to CONTRADICTION: `gradeMustAnswer` never reads this set,
 * so a reply that corrects a claim the corpus actually disagrees with ("the register lists Pinebrook
 * at 18%, not 40%, so that figure is not accurate") scores `deniedPremise` here but still passes the
